Javascript is separate. To use it in HTML, we must include `<script>` tag.

### difference between package.json and package-lock.json
Both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are important files for managing dependencies in a Node.js project, but they serve different purposes:

#### package.json
- **Purpose:** This file acts as the central manifest for your project. It stores important metadata about your project, including:
    - Name
    - Version
    - Description
    - Author information
    - License
    - Scripts (commands to run for tasks like testing or building)
    - Dependencies: This section specifies the external libraries your project relies on. You can define a version range (e.g., "^1.2.3") to allow for some flexibility in which version is installed.
- **Created/modified by:** You (the developer) manually edit this file to specify project details and dependencies.
- **Version control:** This file is essential and should be included in version control systems (like Git)

#### package-lock.json
- **Purpose:** This file is automatically generated by npm (the Node Package Manager) when you install or update dependencies. It serves as a lockfile, ensuring deterministic installations by recording the exact versions of all dependencies (including their sub-dependencies) that were downloaded for your project.
- **Created/modified by:** npm manages this file automatically. Manual changes are generally discouraged as they can lead to inconsistencies.
- **Version control:** This file is also important for maintaining consistency across environments and should be included in version control along with `package.json`.


Here's an analogy:
- Think of `package.json` as a shopping list. You specify the items (dependencies) you need and the general criteria (version ranges) for those items.
- `package-lock.json` is like a receipt. It shows the exact items (dependencies and their versions) that were actually purchased (downloaded) to fulfill your list.

In summary, `package.json` defines what you want, while `package-lock.json` ensures you get exactly that by locking down the specific versions. Having both files ensures a smooth development workflow and consistent project setups across different environments.

`public/manifest.json` -> manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a user's mobile device or desktop.

`public/robots.txt` -> for search engines

public/index.html -> 


DOM is nothing but a tree structure to represent the relationship between html elements.

React creates its own DOM.

### JSX
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. 
- It's not quite XML or standard JavaScript, but a special syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your React components.
- offers
	- **Readability:** JSX makes your React code more readable, especially for people familiar with HTML. It lets you define the UI structure directly within your JavaScript code, keeping the component's logic and presentation closely tied together.
	- **Component-based UI:** JSX forms the building blocks for creating reusable React components. You can use JSX to define the HTML structure and embed dynamic content or logic using JavaScript expressions within the curly braces `{}`.
	- **Not actual HTML:** It's important to remember that JSX is transformed during the build process. The browser doesn't understand JSX directly. Instead, it's compiled into regular JavaScript function calls that React understands and uses to create the UI in the browser.
```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1> Chai aur React </h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

to use it in javascript
```js
<App />
```


`react-scripts` library is vital. It injects react into HTML
```html
<script defer src="/static/js/bundle.js"></script>
```



## 01vitereact project structure

it does not use `react-scripts` library. Instead, it directly adds the script by
```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

Both basic and vite follow the same structure. vite is a liter.



In JSX, you can return only one HTML element. If you want to return more than one element, you can use `<div>` 

e.g. 
```javascript
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <MyApp />
            <h1> this is a h1 tag </h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

but React gives empty <> option (it is called fragment)

```html
function App() {
    return (
        <>
            <MyApp />
            <h1> this is a h1 tag </h1>
        </>
    )
}
```


the components / functions should start with Capital letter or PascalCase
